The expressions are consistent with the new IAU astronomical reference system for epoch J2000.0. The algorithms define the transformation between fundamental reference data, such as star and radio-source catalogs and planetary ephemerides, and astrometric observables.},

  abstract  = {Astrometry encompasses all that is necessary to provide the positions and motions of celestial bodies. This includes observational techniques, instrumentation, processing and analysis of observational data, reference systems and frames, and the resulting astronomical phenomena. Astrometry is fundamental to all other fields of astronomy, from the pointing of telescopes, to navigation and guidance systems, to distance and motion determinations for astrophysics. In the last few decades, new observational techniques have enabled improvements in accuracy by orders of magnitude. Starting from basic principles, this book provides the fundamentals for this new astrometry at milli- and micro-arcsecond accuracies. Topics include: basics of general relativity; co-ordinate systems; vectors, tensors, quaternions, and observational uncertainties; determination and use of the celestial and terrestrial reference systems and frames; applications of new observational techniques; present and future star catalogues and double star astrometry. This comprehensive reference will be invaluable for graduate students and research astronomers.},

The current issue of the IERS Conventions is called the IERS Conventions 2003. When referenced in recommendations and articles published in past years, this document may have been referred to as the IERS Conventions 2000. All of the products of the IERS may be considered to be consistent with the description in this document. If contributors to the IERS do not fully comply with these guidelines, they will carefully identify the exceptions. In these cases, the contributor provides an assessment of the elects of the departures from the conventions so that its results can be referred to the IERS Reference Systems. Contributors may use models equivalent to those specified herein. Products obtained with different observing methods have varying sensitivity to the adopted standards and reference systems, but no attempt has been made in this document to assess this sensitivity. The reference systems and procedures of the IERS are based on the resolutions of international scientific unions. The celestial system is based on IAU International Astronomical Union Resolution A4 1991. It was officially initiated and named by IAU Resolution B2 1997 and its definition was further refined by IAU Resolution B1 2000. The terrestrial system is based on IUGG Resolution 2 1991. The transformation between celestial and terrestrial systems is based on IAU Resolution B1 2000.},
