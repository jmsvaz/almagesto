A detailed description of NOVAS 3.0 may be found in USNO Circular 180 (Kaplan et al. 2009), 2 which consists of user's guides for both the Fortran and C versions. Nutation is a small periodic oscillation of the Earth's axis with respect to a space-fixed reference system (``inertial space'') caused by the torque of the Sun and Moon\textemdash and to a lesser extent, the other planets\textemdash on the Earth's equatorial bulge. Nutation is usually modeled by lengthy trigonometric series that, when evaluated for a specific date and time, yield the values of two ecliptic angles: the nutation in longitude, dPhi, and the nutation in obliquity, dEps. The evaluation of the nutation series is generally the most computationally intensive part of calculating the positions of celestial objects with respect to the traditional celestial coordinate system defined by the true equator and equinox of date. NOVAS provides several nutation series with different numbers of terms, which the user can select depending on the accuracy requirements.},

Their numerical representations, based on numerical values recommended at the working meeting of the International Astronomical Union Commission held in Washington in September 1974, are obtained. In constructing the equations of motion, the second-order secular perturbation and the secular perturbation due to the long-periodic terms in the motions of the moon and the sun are taken into account. These perturbations contribute more to the motion of the mean equator than does the term due to the secular perturbation of the orbital eccentricity of the sun.},

  abstract = {Astrometry encompasses all that is necessary to provide the positions and motions of celestial bodies. This includes observational techniques, instrumentation, processing and analysis of observational data, reference systems and frames, and the resulting astronomical phenomena. Astrometry is fundamental to all other fields of astronomy, from the pointing of telescopes, to navigation and guidance systems, to distance and motion determinations for astrophysics. In the last few decades, new observational techniques have enabled improvements in accuracy by orders of magnitude. Starting from basic principles, this book provides the fundamentals for this new astrometry at milli- and micro-arcsecond accuracies. Topics include: basics of general relativity; co-ordinate systems; vectors, tensors, quaternions, and observational uncertainties; determination and use of the celestial and terrestrial reference systems and frames; applications of new observational techniques; present and future star catalogues and double star astrometry. This comprehensive reference will be invaluable for graduate students and research astronomers.},
