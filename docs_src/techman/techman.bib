  abstract = {Universal time, UT1, is formally defined by an expression which relates it to mean sidereal time, the latter quantity being directly obtained from the apparent right ascensions of transiting stars. The current formula which relates universal and sidereal time is based on Newcomb's (1895) expression for the right ascension of the fictitious mean sun. The planned introduction on January 1, 1984, of improvements to the definition of the astronomical reference system and the equinox of FK5 necessitate a reexamination of the definition of UT1. The problem of the redefinition of universal time is considered, and a new expression relating universal time and sidereal time is developed for use with the new astronomical reference system. The new expression is based on the final values adopted for the position of the FK5 equinox, and is given to the same precision as that of the new precession expressions.},

  abstract = {Present observations using modern astrometric techniques are supposed to  provide the Earth orientation parameters, and therefore UT1, with an accuracy better than {$\pm$}1 mas. In practice, UT1 is determined through the intermediary of Greenwich Sidereal Time (GST), using both the conventional relationship between Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time (GMST) and UTl (Aoki et al. 1982) and the so-called "equation of the equinoxes" limited to the first order terms with respect to the nutation quantities. This highly complex relation between sidereal time and UT1 is not accurate at the milliaresecond level which gives rise to spurious terms of milliaresecond amplitude in the derived UTl. A more complete relationship between GST and UT1 has been recommended by Aoki \& Kinoshita (1983) and Aoki (1991) taking into account the second order terms in the difference between GST and GM ST, the largest one having an amplitude of 2.64 mas and a 18.6 yr-period. This paper explains how this complete expansion of GST implicitly uses the concept of "nonrotating origin" (NRO) as proposed by Guinot in 1979 and would, therefore, provide a more accurate value of UTl and consequently of the Earth's angular velocity. This paper shows, moreover, that such a procedure would be simplified and conceptually clarified by the explicit use of the NRO as previously proposed (Guinot 1979; Capitaine et al. 1986). The two corresponding options (implicit or explicit use of the NRO) are shown to be equivalent for defining the specific Earth's angle of rotation and then UT1. The of the use of such an accurate procedure which has been proposed in the new IERS standards (McCarthy 1992a) instead of the usual one are estimated for the practical derivation of UT1.},

Several possibilities have been suggested. This paper considers the use of the non-rotating origin (Guinot 1979). The ``Celestial Ephemeris Origin'' (CEO) is defined here as the non-rotating origin on the equator of the Celestial Ephemeris Pole (CEP). Developments valid at the microarcsecond, based on the best model for precession, nutation and pole offset at J2000.0 with respect to the pole of ICRF, are provided for computing the CEP coordinates and the position of the CEO. It is shown that an operational definition of UT1 based on the CEO leads to values which are insensitive at the microarcsecond level to future improvements of this model.

  abstract = {A new precession-nutation model for the Celestial Intermediate Pole (CIP) was adopted by the IAU in 2000 (Resolution B1.6). The model, designated IAU 2000A, includes a nutation series for a non-rigid Earth and corrections for the precession rates in longitude and obliquity. The model also specifies numerical values for the pole offsets at J2000.0 between the mean equatorial frame and the Geocentric Celestial Reference System (GCRS). In this paper, we discuss precession models consistent with IAU 2000A precession-nutation (i.e. MHB 2000, provided by Mathews et al. 2002) and we provide a range of expressions that implement them. The final precession model, designated P03, is a possible replacement for the precession component of IAU 2000A, offering improved dynamical consistency and a better basis for future improvement. As a preliminary step, we present our expressions for the currently used precession quantities {$\zeta$}A, \texttheta A, zA, in agreement with the MHB corrections to the precession rates, that appear in the IERS Conventions 2000. We then discuss a more sophisticated method for improving the precession model of the equator in order that it be compliant with the IAU 2000A model. In contrast to the first method, which is based on corrections to the t terms of the developments for the precession quantities in longitude and obliquity, this method also uses corrections to their higher degree terms. It is essential that this be used in conjunction with an improved model for the ecliptic precession, which is expected, given the known discrepancies in the IAU 1976 expressions, to contribute in a significant way to these higher degree terms. With this aim in view, we have developed new expressions for the motion of the ecliptic with respect to the fixed ecliptic using the developments from Simon et al. (1994) and Williams (1994) and with improved constants fitted to the most recent numerical planetary ephemerides. We have then used these new expressions for the ecliptic together with the MHB corrections to precession rates to solve the precession equations for providing new solution for the precession of the equator that is dynamically consistent and compliant with IAU 2000. A number of perturbing effects have first been removed from the MHB estimates in order to get the physical quantities needed in the equations as integration constants. The equations have then been solved in a similar way to Lieske et al. (1977) and Williams (1994), based on similar theoretical expressions for the contributions to precession rates, revised by using MHB values. Once improved expressions have been obtained for the precession of the ecliptic and the equator, we discuss the most suitable precession quantities to be considered in order to be based on the minimum number of variables and to be the best adapted to the most recent models and observations. Finally we provide developments for these quantities, denoted the P03 solution, including a revised Sidereal Time expression.},

  abstract = {Coordinated Universal Time or UTC is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It is within about 1 second of mean solar time at 0\textdegree{} longitude, and is not adjusted for daylight saving time. It is effectively a successor to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The coordination of time and frequency transmissions around the world began on 1 January 1960. UTC was first officially adopted as CCIR Recommendation 374, Standard-Frequency and Time-Signal Emissions, in 1963, but the official abbreviation of UTC and the official English name of Coordinated Universal Time (along with the French equivalent) were not adopted until 1967.The system has been adjusted several times, including a brief period where the time-coordination radio signals broadcast both UTC and "Stepped Atomic Time (SAT)" before a new UTC was adopted in 1970 and implemented in 1972. This change also adopted leap seconds to simplify future adjustments. This CCIR Recommendation 460 "stated that (a) carrier frequencies and time intervals should be maintained constant and should correspond to the definition of the SI second; (b) step adjustments, when necessary, should be exactly 1 s to maintain approximate agreement with Universal Time (UT); and (c) standard signals should contain information on the difference between UTC and UT."A number of proposals have been made to replace UTC with a new system that would eliminate leap seconds. A decision whether to remove them altogether has been deferred until 2023.The current version of UTC is defined by International Telecommunication Union Recommendation (ITU-R TF.460-6), Standard-frequency and time-signal emissions, and is based on International Atomic Time (TAI) with leap seconds added at irregular intervals to compensate for the slowing of the Earth's rotation. Leap seconds are inserted as necessary to keep UTC within 0.9 second of the UT1 variant of universal time. See the "Current number of leap seconds" section for the number of leap seconds inserted to date.},

  abstract = {Daylight saving time (DST), also daylight savings time or daylight time (the United States and Canada) and summer time (United Kingdom, European Union, and others), is the practice of advancing clocks during warmer months so that darkness falls later each day according to the clock. The typical implementation of DST is to set clocks forward by one hour in the spring ("spring forward") and set clocks back by one hour in autumn ("fall back", from the North American English word "fall" for autumn) to return to standard time. As a result, there is one 23-hour day in late winter or early spring and one 25-hour day in the autumn. George Hudson proposed the idea of daylight saving in 1895. The German Empire and Austria-Hungary organized the first nationwide implementation starting on April 30, 1916. Many countries have used it at various times since then, particularly since the 1970s energy crisis. DST is generally not observed near the equator, where sunrise and sunset times do not vary enough to justify it. Some countries observe it only in some regions; for example, parts of Australia observe it, while other parts do not, and the United States observes it, while Arizona does not. Only a minority of the world's population uses DST; Asia and Africa generally do not observe it. DST clock shifts sometimes complicate timekeeping and can disrupt travel, billing, record keeping, medical devices, heavy equipment, and sleep patterns. Computer software generally adjusts clocks automatically.},

The UTC time standard, widely used for international timekeeping and as the reference for civil time in most countries, uses precise atomic time and consequently would run ahead of observed solar time unless it is reset to UT1 as needed. The leap second facility exists to provide this adjustment.   Because the Earth's rotation speed varies in response to climatic and geological events, UTC leap seconds are irregularly spaced and unpredictable. Insertion of each UTC leap second is usually decided about six months in advance by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), to ensure that the difference between the UTC and UT1 readings will never exceed 0.9 seconds.This practice has proven disruptive, particularly in the twenty-first century and especially in services that depend on precise time stamping or time-critical process control. The relevant international standards body has been debating whether or not to continue the practice.},

It is shown that the basic set of parameters, upon which depend the lengthy polynomials for computing the mean obliquity of data and the elements of the precession matrix, consists of the mean obliquity, the speed of general precession in longitude at a fixed epoch, and the system of planetary masses. Special attention is given to the motion of the ecliptic pole, formulations for a basic epoch as well as an arbitrary epoch, and ecliptic motion relative to the basic epoch. Numerical precession quantities at epoch J2000.0 (JED 2451545.0) are presented which result from the revision of astronomical constants adopted at the XVI General Assembly of the IAU.},

  abstract = {Precise astrometric observations show that significant systematic differences of the order of 10 milliarcseconds (mas) exist between the observed position of the celestial pole in the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) and the position determined using the International Astronomical Union (IAU) 1976 Precession (Lieske et al., 1977) and the IAU 1980 Nutation Theory (Seidelmann, 1982). The International Earth Rotation Service routinely publishes these `celestial pole offsets', and the IERS Conventions (McCarthy, 1996) recommends a procedure to account for these errors. The IAU, at its General Assembly in 2000, adopted a new precession/nutation model (Mathews et al., 2002). This model, designated IAU2000A, which includes nearly 1400 terms, provides the direction of the celestial pole in the ICRF with an accuracy of +/-0.1 mas. Users requiring accuracy no better than 1 mas, however, may not require the full model, particularly if computational time or storage are issues. Consequently, the IAU also adopted an abridged procedure designated IAU2000B to model the celestial pole motion with an accuracy that does not result in a difference greater than 1 mas with respect to that of the IAU2000A model. That IAU2000B model, presented here, is shown to have the required accuracy for a period of more than 50 years from 1995 to 2050.},

It was found that there are a number of problems concerning the theory of nutation currently in use, which is due to Woolard (1953). A number of changes were proposed in order to eliminate these problems. The changes are related to the use of a nonrigid model of the earth without axial symmetry, constants which are consistent with the 1976 IAU System of Astronomical Constants, and the selection of the reference pole. The new nutation theory, incorporating the considered changes, is to be referred to as the '1980 IAU Theory of Nutation'. This nutation theory was developed by Wahr (1979, 1981) based on previous work by Kinoshita (1977) and Gilbert and Dziewonski (1975).},

Also we give the derivatives of these expressions with respect to the masses of the planets, to the precession constant and to the obliquity. So, this set of formulas is applicable whenever the values of the planetary masses and of the constants are improved. Afterwards, we give the mean elements of the Moon and the planets connected to the fixed J2000 ecliptic and connected to the ecliptic of date. At last, we give formula which enable one to compute approximate ephemerides of the Moon and the planets from mean elements.},

This paper is the third and last one in the frame of the complete reconstruction of the theory of the rigid Earth nutation. It is the complementary part to previous studies concerning the luni-solar nutation involving indirect planetary effects (Souchay \& Kinoshita 1996), and the influence of the second-order geopotential (J3, J4) and of the direct planetary effect (Souchay \& Kinoshita 1997). Quasi-diurnal and sub-diurnal nutations coming from the harmonics of degree 2, 3 and 4 of the geopotential are also included in REN-2000, their values being taken from Folgueira et al. (1998a,b).

  abstract = {Standard time is the synchronization of clocks within a geographical area or region to a single time standard, rather than using solar time or a locally chosen meridian (longitude) to establish a local mean time standard. Generally, standard time agrees with the local mean time at some meridian that passes through the region, often near the center of the region. Historically, the concept was established during the 19th century to aid weather forecasting and train travel. Applied globally in the 20th century, the geographical areas became extended around evenly spaced meridians into time zones which (usually) centered on them. The standard time set in each time zone has come to be defined in terms of offsets from Universal Time. In regions where daylight saving time is used, that time is defined by another offset, from the standard time in its applicable time zones. The adoption of standard time, because of the inseparable correspondence between time and longitude, solidified the concepts of halving the globe into an eastern and western hemisphere, with one prime meridian (as well its opposite International Date Line) replacing the various prime meridians that had previously been used.},

  abstract = {Records of solar and lunar eclipses in the period 700 BC to AD 1600, originating from the ancient and medieval civilizations of Babylon, China, Europe and the Arab world, are amassed and critically appraised for their usefulness in answering questions about the long-term variability of the Earth's rate of rotation. Results from previous analyses of lunar occultations in the period AD 1600-1955.5, and from high-precision data in AD 1955.5-1990, are included in the dataset considered in this paper. Using the change in the length of the mean solar day (l.o.d.) in units of milliseconds per century (ms cy-1) as the measure of acceleration in the rate of rotation, it is found that the l.o.d. has increased by (+1.70 {$\pm$} 0.05) ms cy-1 (equiv (-4.5 {$\pm$} 0.1) \texttimes{} 10-22 rad s-2) on average over the past 2700 years. Yet an increase of +2.3 {$\pm$} 0.1 ms cy-1 (equiv (-6.1 {$\pm$} 0.4) \texttimes{} 10-22 rad s-2) is expected from the tidal braking of the Earth's spin, assuming a value of -26.0' ' cy-2 for the tidal acceleration of the Moon. There is thus an average accelerative component in the Earth's rotation which acts to decrease the l.o.d. by (-0.6 {$\pm$} 0.1) ms cy-1 (equiv (+1.6 {$\pm$} 0.4) \texttimes{} 10-22 rad s-2). Moreover, it is shown that besides this accelerative component, there is a fluctuation in the l.o.d. with a semi-amplitude of \textasciitilde{} 4 ms and a period of \textasciitilde{} 1500 yr.},

Some higher latitude and temperate zone countries use daylight saving time for part of the year, typically by adjusting local clock time by an hour. Many land time zones are skewed toward the west of the corresponding nautical time zones. This also creates  permanent daylight saving time effect.},

We discuss IAU 2006 based procedures and algorithms for generating the rotation matrices that transform celestial to terrestrial coordinates, taking into account frame bias (B), P03 precession (P), P03-adjusted IAU 2000A nutation (N) and Earth rotation. The NPB portion can refer either to the equinox or to the celestial intermediate origin (CIO), requiring either the Greenwich sidereal time (GST) or the Earth rotation angle (ERA) as the measure of Earth rotation. Where GST is used, it is derived from ERA and the equation of the origins (EO) rather than through an explicit formula as in the past, and the EO itself is derived from the CIO locator. Results. We provide precession-nutation procedures for two different classes of full-accuracy application, namely (i) the construction of algorithm collections such as the Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy (SOFA) library and (ii) IERS Conventions, and in addition some concise procedures for applications where the highest accuracy is not a requirement. The appendix contains a fully worked numerical example, to aid implementors and to illustrate the consistency of the two full-accuracy procedures which, for the test date, agree to better than 1 \textmu as. Conclusions. The paper recommends, for case (i), procedures based on angles to represent the PB and N components and, for case (ii), procedures based on series for the CIP X, Y.
