  abstract = {Universal time, UT1, is formally defined by an expression which relates it to mean sidereal time, the latter quantity being directly obtained from the apparent right ascensions of transiting stars. The current formula which relates universal and sidereal time is based on Newcomb's (1895) expression for the right ascension of the fictitious mean sun. The planned introduction on January 1, 1984, of improvements to the definition of the astronomical reference system and the equinox of FK5 necessitate a reexamination of the definition of UT1. The problem of the redefinition of universal time is considered, and a new expression relating universal time and sidereal time is developed for use with the new astronomical reference system. The new expression is based on the final values adopted for the position of the FK5 equinox, and is given to the same precision as that of the new precession expressions.},

  abstract = {Present observations using modern astrometric techniques are supposed to  provide the Earth orientation parameters, and therefore UT1, with an accuracy better than {$\pm$}1 mas. In practice, UT1 is determined through the intermediary of Greenwich Sidereal Time (GST), using both the conventional relationship between Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time (GMST) and UTl (Aoki et al. 1982) and the so-called "equation of the equinoxes" limited to the first order terms with respect to the nutation quantities. This highly complex relation between sidereal time and UT1 is not accurate at the milliaresecond level which gives rise to spurious terms of milliaresecond amplitude in the derived UTl. A more complete relationship between GST and UT1 has been recommended by Aoki \& Kinoshita (1983) and Aoki (1991) taking into account the second order terms in the difference between GST and GM ST, the largest one having an amplitude of 2.64 mas and a 18.6 yr-period. This paper explains how this complete expansion of GST implicitly uses the concept of "nonrotating origin" (NRO) as proposed by Guinot in 1979 and would, therefore, provide a more accurate value of UTl and consequently of the Earth's angular velocity. This paper shows, moreover, that such a procedure would be simplified and conceptually clarified by the explicit use of the NRO as previously proposed (Guinot 1979; Capitaine et al. 1986). The two corresponding options (implicit or explicit use of the NRO) are shown to be equivalent for defining the specific Earth's angle of rotation and then UT1. The of the use of such an accurate procedure which has been proposed in the new IERS standards (McCarthy 1992a) instead of the usual one are estimated for the practical derivation of UT1.},

Several possibilities have been suggested. This paper considers the use of the non-rotating origin (Guinot 1979). The ``Celestial Ephemeris Origin'' (CEO) is defined here as the non-rotating origin on the equator of the Celestial Ephemeris Pole (CEP). Developments valid at the microarcsecond, based on the best model for precession, nutation and pole offset at J2000.0 with respect to the pole of ICRF, are provided for computing the CEP coordinates and the position of the CEO. It is shown that an operational definition of UT1 based on the CEO leads to values which are insensitive at the microarcsecond level to future improvements of this model.

  abstract = {A new precession-nutation model for the Celestial Intermediate Pole (CIP) was adopted by the IAU in 2000 (Resolution B1.6). The model, designated IAU 2000A, includes a nutation series for a non-rigid Earth and corrections for the precession rates in longitude and obliquity. The model also specifies numerical values for the pole offsets at J2000.0 between the mean equatorial frame and the Geocentric Celestial Reference System (GCRS). In this paper, we discuss precession models consistent with IAU 2000A precession-nutation (i.e. MHB 2000, provided by Mathews et al. 2002) and we provide a range of expressions that implement them. The final precession model, designated P03, is a possible replacement for the precession component of IAU 2000A, offering improved dynamical consistency and a better basis for future improvement. As a preliminary step, we present our expressions for the currently used precession quantities {$\zeta$}A, \texttheta A, zA, in agreement with the MHB corrections to the precession rates, that appear in the IERS Conventions 2000. We then discuss a more sophisticated method for improving the precession model of the equator in order that it be compliant with the IAU 2000A model. In contrast to the first method, which is based on corrections to the t terms of the developments for the precession quantities in longitude and obliquity, this method also uses corrections to their higher degree terms. It is essential that this be used in conjunction with an improved model for the ecliptic precession, which is expected, given the known discrepancies in the IAU 1976 expressions, to contribute in a significant way to these higher degree terms. With this aim in view, we have developed new expressions for the motion of the ecliptic with respect to the fixed ecliptic using the developments from Simon et al. (1994) and Williams (1994) and with improved constants fitted to the most recent numerical planetary ephemerides. We have then used these new expressions for the ecliptic together with the MHB corrections to precession rates to solve the precession equations for providing new solution for the precession of the equator that is dynamically consistent and compliant with IAU 2000. A number of perturbing effects have first been removed from the MHB estimates in order to get the physical quantities needed in the equations as integration constants. The equations have then been solved in a similar way to Lieske et al. (1977) and Williams (1994), based on similar theoretical expressions for the contributions to precession rates, revised by using MHB values. Once improved expressions have been obtained for the precession of the ecliptic and the equator, we discuss the most suitable precession quantities to be considered in order to be based on the minimum number of variables and to be the best adapted to the most recent models and observations. Finally we provide developments for these quantities, denoted the P03 solution, including a revised Sidereal Time expression.},

The International Earth Rotation Service routinely publishes these `celestial pole offsets', and the IERS Conventions (McCarthy, 1996) recommends a procedure to account for these errors. The IAU, at its General Assembly in 2000, adopted a new precession/nutation model (Mathews et al., 2002). This model, designated IAU2000A, which includes nearly 1400 terms, provides the direction of the celestial pole in the ICRF with an accuracy of +/-0.1 mas. Users requiring accuracy no better than 1 mas, however, may not require the full model, particularly if computational time or storage are issues. Consequently, the IAU also adopted an abridged procedure designated IAU2000B to model the celestial pole motion with an accuracy that does not result in a difference greater than 1 mas with respect to that of the IAU2000A model. That IAU2000B model, presented here, is shown to have the required accuracy for a period of more than 50 years from 1995 to 2050.},

  abstract = {The difference between the uniform Dynamical Time and Universal Time, known as ?T (Delta T), is needed in several astronomical calculations, such as eclipses and occultations, or to reduce measured positions of minor planets to a uniform time scale for the aim of orbital determinations. As Universal Time is based on the variable rotation of the Earth, the quantity ?T reflects the irregularities of that rotation, so it varies slowly but rather irregularly with time. We have done some work on empirical formulae for approximating ?T and have derived a set of polynomials of the 4th order which are accurate to within +/-1 second for the period 1620-2000.},

  abstract = {The President of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Commission 4  established the Working Group on Nutation at the request of the IAU Symposium No. 78 on Nutation and Earth's Rotation in May 1977. It was found that there are a number of problems concerning the theory of nutation currently in use, which is due to Woolard (1953). A number of changes were proposed in order to eliminate these problems. The changes are related to the use of a nonrigid model of the earth without axial symmetry, constants which are consistent with the 1976 IAU System of Astronomical Constants, and the selection of the reference pole. The new nutation theory, incorporating the considered changes, is to be referred to as the '1980 IAU Theory of Nutation'. This nutation theory was developed by Wahr (1979, 1981) based on previous work by Kinoshita (1977) and Gilbert and Dziewonski (1975).},

First, using the notations of Lieske et al. (1977), we construct expressions for the precession quantities based upon the use of the secular variations of the ecliptic pole from the planetary theories built at the Bureau des Longitudes and taking into account recent determinations of the precession constant and of the obliquity in J2000. Also we give the derivatives of these expressions with respect to the masses of the planets, to the precession constant and to the obliquity. So, this set of formulas is applicable whenever the values of the planetary masses and of the constants are improved. Afterwards, we give the mean elements of the Moon and the planets connected to the fixed J2000 ecliptic and connected to the ecliptic of date. At last, we give formula which enable one to compute approximate ephemerides of the Moon and the planets from mean elements.},

For this presentation to be achieved we first carry out the calculations of the second-order effects due to crossed-nutations and spin-orbit coupling, at the same level of truncation as above. This paper is the third and last one in the frame of the complete reconstruction of the theory of the rigid Earth nutation. It is the complementary part to previous studies concerning the luni-solar nutation involving indirect planetary effects (Souchay \& Kinoshita 1996), and the influence of the second-order geopotential (J3, J4) and of the direct planetary effect (Souchay \& Kinoshita 1997). Quasi-diurnal and sub-diurnal nutations coming from the harmonics of degree 2, 3 and 4 of the geopotential are also included in REN-2000, their values being taken from Folgueira et al. (1998a,b). A presentation of the series REN-2000 is done at the end of the paper, with separated informations for each contribution.},

  abstract = {Records of solar and lunar eclipses in the period 700 BC to AD 1600, originating from the ancient and medieval civilizations of Babylon, China, Europe and the Arab world, are amassed and critically appraised for their usefulness in answering questions about the long-term variability of the Earth's rate of rotation. Results from previous analyses of lunar occultations in the period AD 1600-1955.5, and from high-precision data in AD 1955.5-1990, are included in the dataset considered in this paper. Using the change in the length of the mean solar day (l.o.d.) in units of milliseconds per century (ms cy-1) as the measure of acceleration in the rate of rotation, it is found that the l.o.d. has increased by (+1.70 {$\pm$} 0.05) ms cy-1 (equiv (-4.5 {$\pm$} 0.1) \texttimes{} 10-22 rad s-2) on average over the past 2700 years. Yet an increase of +2.3 {$\pm$} 0.1 ms cy-1 (equiv (-6.1 {$\pm$} 0.4) \texttimes{} 10-22 rad s-2) is expected from the tidal braking of the Earth's spin, assuming a value of -26.0' ' cy-2 for the tidal acceleration of the Moon. There is thus an average accelerative component in the Earth's rotation which acts to decrease the l.o.d. by (-0.6 {$\pm$} 0.1) ms cy-1 (equiv (+1.6 {$\pm$} 0.4) \texttimes{} 10-22 rad s-2). Moreover, it is shown that besides this accelerative component, there is a fluctuation in the l.o.d. with a semi-amplitude of \textasciitilde{} 4 ms and a period of \textasciitilde{} 1500 yr.},

We discuss IAU 2006 based procedures and algorithms for generating the rotation matrices that transform celestial to terrestrial coordinates, taking into account frame bias (B), P03 precession (P), P03-adjusted IAU 2000A nutation (N) and Earth rotation. The NPB portion can refer either to the equinox or to the celestial intermediate origin (CIO), requiring either the Greenwich sidereal time (GST) or the Earth rotation angle (ERA) as the measure of Earth rotation. Where GST is used, it is derived from ERA and the equation of the origins (EO) rather than through an explicit formula as in the past, and the EO itself is derived from the CIO locator. Results. We provide precession-nutation procedures for two different classes of full-accuracy application, namely (i) the construction of algorithm collections such as the Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy (SOFA) library and (ii) IERS Conventions, and in addition some concise procedures for applications where the highest accuracy is not a requirement. The appendix contains a fully worked numerical example, to aid implementors and to illustrate the consistency of the two full-accuracy procedures which, for the test date, agree to better than 1 \textmu as. Conclusions. The paper recommends, for case (i), procedures based on angles to represent the PB and N components and, for case (ii), procedures based on series for the CIP X, Y. The two methods are of similar efficiency, and both support equinox based as well as CIO based applications.},
