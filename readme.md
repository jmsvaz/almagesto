# ALMAGESTO

## What is Almagesto?

Almagesto is a free source-code library in pascal that provides common astronomical and astrometric quantities and transformations. The algorithms used in Almagesto are based on a vector and matrix formulation that is rigorous and consistent with the recommendations by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) and the conventions by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS).

## Requirements

- Free Pascal Compiler: [<http://www.freepascal.org/>]
- Lazarus IDE: [<https://www.lazarus-ide.org/>] (optional)

The library is tested with the latest stable Free Pascal Compiler (currently 3.2.0) and Lazarus IDE (currently 2.0.10).

## Installing

Get the sources and add the _src_ directory to the _fpc.cfg_ file.

If you use the Lazarus IDE, you may install a Lazarus package, located at the _lpk_ dir. This way, there's no need to manualy change the _fpc.cfg_ file.

## Using

Just add the units you want to use to the `uses` clause.
